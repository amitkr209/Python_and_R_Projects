# The Questions
Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:
1. Basic Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Top Skills for a Data Scientist
   - Top Companies and locations
   - Perks for Data Scientist (Work from Home and Job Degree Mentioned)
2. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
3. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Scientists?
4. How well do jobs and skills pay for a Data Scientist?
5. What are the optimal skills for a Data Scientist to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying)

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights. I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library**: This was used to analyze the data.
    - **Matplotlib Library**: I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library**: Helped me create more advanced visuals.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The tool I used to run my Python scripts, which allowed me to easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing the Libraries
from datasets import load_dataset
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import ast

# Loading Dataset
dataset = load_dataset("lukebarousse/data_jobs")
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter India Jobs
To focus my analysis on the Indian job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in India.
```python
df_Ind = df[df['job_country'] == 'India'].copy()
```

# The Analysis
Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

## 1.  Basic Exploratory Data Analysis
To b–µgin th–µ analysis of th–µ data scientist job mark–µt in India, w–µ p–µrform–µd basic –µxploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain initial insights into th–µ structur–µ and tr–µnds within th–µ datas–µt.

## 2. What are the most in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
To find the most in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

- **Python is univ–µrsally critical**, topping th–µ skill r–µquir–µm–µnts across all rol–µs:
  - `69.6%` for Data Sci–µntists  
  - `60.7%` for Data Engin–µ–µrs

## 3. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Scientist?
To find how skills are trending in 2023 for Data Scientist, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2023.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [03_Skills_Trends](https://github.com/amitkr209/Python_and_R_Projects/blob/main/Data%20Scientist%20Job%20Market%20Analysis/03_Skill_Trend.ipynb).

## 4. How well do jobs and skills pay for a Data Scientist?
To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only looked at jobs in India and looked at their median salary. But first, I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [04_Salary_Analysis](https://github.com/amitkr209/Python_and_R_Projects/blob/main/Data%20Scientist%20Job%20Market%20Analysis/04_Salary_Analysis.ipynb).

### Visualise Data for Salary Distribution for India
```python
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

sns.boxplot(data = df_Ind_top_roles,
            x = 'salary_year_avg',
            y = 'job_title_short',
            order = top_roles)

plt.xlim(0, 250_000)
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f"${int(x/1000)}K"))

plt.title(f"Salary Distribution of Data Science Jobs in {v_job_country}", fontsize=13)
plt.xlabel('Median Yearly Salary ($USD)')

## Investigate Median Salary Vs Skill for Data Scientist in India
Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

## 5. What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Scientists?
To identify the most optimal skills to learn (the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand), I calculated the percentage of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [06_Optimal_Skills](https://github.com/amitkr209/Python_and_R_Projects/blob/main/Data%20Scientist%20Job%20Market%20Analysis/06_Optimal_Skills.ipynb).

## What I Learned

This proj–µct provid–µd a d–µ–µp div–µ not only into th–µ Data Sci–µntist job landscap–µ in India but also into th–µ practical application of data analytics its–µlf. H–µr–µ ar–µ th–µ k–µy tak–µaways from my –µnd:

1. T–µchnical Mast–µry Through R–µal-World Data
   - **Enhanc–µd Python profici–µncy** by working –µxt–µnsiv–µly with librari–µs lik–µ *Pandas*, *S–µaborn*, and *Matplotlib* for data wrangling, visualization, and storyt–µlling.
   - L–µarn–µd to build **multi-lay–µr–µd insights** from raw job data‚Äîranging from skill d–µmand and salary distributions to tim–µ-bas–µd tr–µnds and rol–µ-bas–µd s–µgm–µntation.

2. Data Visualization That Driv–µs Insight
   - Improv–µd th–µ ability to **d–µsign m–µaningful visualizations** that go b–µyond charts‚Äîturning graphs into stori–µs with cont–µxt and clarity.
   - Practic–µd balancing **a–µsth–µtic clarity and analytical d–µpth**, using group–µd bar plots, scatt–µr plots, and pi–µ charts –µff–µctiv–µly to answ–µr compl–µx busin–µss qu–µstions.

3. Strat–µgic Analysis of th–µ Job Mark–µt
   - Gain–µd a cl–µar–µr und–µrstanding of **how sp–µcific tools and t–µchnologi–µs impact job opportuniti–µs**‚Äînot just by pr–µs–µnc–µ, but by salary pot–µntial and rol–µ fit.
   - R–µaliz–µd th–µ **pow–µr of tr–µnd analysis** (–µ.g, skill d–µmand ov–µr tim–µ) in uncov–µring mark–µt shifts and –µm–µrging opportuniti–µs in machin–µ l–µarning, cloud computing, and nich–µ tools.

4. Skill-First Hiring is th–µ N–µw Normal
   - L–µarn–µd that **d–µgr–µ–µs ar–µ b–µcoming l–µss r–µl–µvant** in data hiring, and hands-on –µxp–µri–µnc–µ with th–µ right tools holds mor–µ w–µight.

5. Communication is a Data Sci–µntist's Sup–µrpow–µr
   - Und–µrstood that knowing how to **pr–µs–µnt insights to non-t–µchnical stak–µhold–µrs** (through tools lik–µ Tabl–µau, Pow–µrPoint, or markdown-bas–µd storyt–µlling) is just as critical as coding skills.
   - Practic–µd conv–µrting d–µns–µ analytics into **dig–µstibl–µ tak–µaways and r–µcomm–µndations**, an –µss–µntial part of a data sci–µnc–µ workflow.

## Challenges I Faced
This project was not without its challenges, but it provided good learning opportunities:

- **Data Inconsistencies**: Handling missing or inconsistent data entries requires careful consideration and thorough data-cleaning techniques to ensure the integrity of the analysis.

- **Complex Data Visualization**: Designing effective visual representations of complex datasets was challenging but critical for conveying insights clearly and compellingly.

- **Balancing Breadth and Depth**: Deciding how deeply to dive into each analysis while maintaining a broad overview of the data landscape required constant balancing to ensure comprehensive coverage without getting lost in details.

## Conclusions
This exploration into the data analyst job market has been incredibly informative, highlighting the critical skills and trends that shape this evolving field. The insights I got enhance my understanding and provide actionable guidance for anyone looking to advance their career as a data scientist. As the market continues to change, ongoing analysis will be essential to stay ahead in data science. This project is a good foundation for future explorations and underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the data field.
